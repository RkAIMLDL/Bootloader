    <h1>Bootloader Documentation</h1>

    <p>
        The bootloader is a program stored in reserved flash memory that can initialize a device, update firmware images, and possibly perform some integrity checks.
        Firmware image update occurs on demand, either by serial communication or over the air.
        Production-level programming is typically done during the product manufacturing process, yet it is desirable to be able to reprogram the system after production is complete.
        More importantly, it is valuable to be able to update the device's firmware with new features and bug fixes after deployment.
        The firmware image update capability makes that possible.
